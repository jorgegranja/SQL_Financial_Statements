# SQL_Financial_Statements
Using SQL queries to build: Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) and Balance Sheet statements

<h2>Project Description</h2>

The objective of this project was to automatically generate formated financial statements by using SQL queries.
All the queries and processing were performed using MySQL and the data was pulled from a remote server. 

The original database has not been published due to privacy/confidentiality concerns,  a modified copy can be provided if requested.

The source of this database was the output of an ERP/Accounting system from a real business operating in the US. 
This database contained 10200+ transactions in the form of a ledger.

From the Accounting system a database was exported containing multiple tables as we can see in the Entity Relationship Diagram. </br>[ERD Diagram](https://github.com/jorgegranja/SQL_Financial_Statements/blob/main/ERD_Accounting_System.png)

The Output from the queries is displayed as a screenshot taken from MySQL and attached into a .pdf file. </br>[Output: Financial Statements](https://github.com/jorgegranja/SQL_Financial_Statements/blob/main/Output_Financial_Statements.pdf)
